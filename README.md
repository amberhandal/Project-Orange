# Project-Orange

The goal of this project was to sort the data from flights between 1990 and 2009 based on most popular destination city and destination with the most number of flights traveled to in a single month. The program implements both merge and radix sort and compares the time taken to sort the data between the two. The flight data used came from the following link: https://academictorrents.com/details/a2ccf94bbb4af222bf8e69dad60a68a29f310d9a
